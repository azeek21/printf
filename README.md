# printf
Another project at School 21. This time I wrote my own ```ft_printf()``` function that mimics the original ```printf()```
function from ```<stdio.h>``` library.

* You can clone the repository and run your own test. 
* or, use tester inside the ```printfTester``` directory.
To run tester in the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/azeek21/printf.git
cd printf/printfTester/
make m
```

and it runs all the mandatory test.
